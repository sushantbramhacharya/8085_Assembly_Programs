# Introduction to 8085 
- 8085 is a microprocessor which has 16 bit address bus and 8 data and control Bus.
- It has components Like registers where we can load Data
- ALU (Arthemetic and Logical Unit)
  - ALU is responsible for performing Arthmetic and logical operations.
  - ALU gets input from Accumulator and Temp Register which get Processed.
  - While Processing ALU can also produce FLAGS of the operations.
  - ALU output gets stored into Accumulator.
- Accumulator is also known as Register A or AC.
- Registers
  - Register are the collection of Flipflops in Which we can store data in binary bit form.
  - 7 Regular Registers Can Be used by programmer in 8085 Each 8 bit.
    - A,B,C,D,E,H,L
